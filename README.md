# Medical Image Contrast Enhancement (MH-FIL)

This repository presents MATLAB implementations of a contrast enhancement method for low-quality medical images based on Modified Histogram Equalization and Homomorphic Filtering (MH-FIL). The project includes experiments on mammography and chest X-ray images, with visual comparisons against HE, CLAHE, and Unsharp Masking. Quantitative evaluation using AMBE and entropy metrics shows improved clarity and brightness preservation. Sample input/output photos and intermediate results are provided for reproducibility.
